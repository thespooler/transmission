It runs on Mac OS X (Cocoa interface) and
Linux/NetBSD/FreeBSD/OpenBSD (GTK+ and Qt interfaces).

Building Transmission
=====================

Transmission has an Xcode project file (Transmission.xcodeproj)
for building in Xcode.

For a more detailed description, and dependancies, visit:
http://trac.transmissionbt.com/wiki/

Building a Transmission release from the command line:

    $ tar xvfj transmission-1.40.tar.bz2
    $ cd transmission-1.40
    $ ./configure -q && make -s
    $ su (if necessary for the next line)
    $ make install

Building Transmission from the nightly builds:

    Download a tarball from http://build.transmissionbt.com/job/trunk-linux-inc/
    and follow the steps from the previous section.

    If you're new to building programs from source code, this is typically 
    easier than building from SVN.

Building Transmission from SVN (First Time):

    $ svn co svn://svn.m0k.org/Transmission/trunk Transmission
    $ cd Transmission
    $ ./autogen.sh && make -s
    $ su (if necessary for the next line)
    $ make install

Building Transmission from SVN (Updating):

    $ cd Transmission
    $ make clean
    $ svn up
    $ ./update-version-h.sh 
    $ make -s
    $ su (if necessary for the next line)
    $ make install



Notes for building on Solaris' C compiler:  User av reports success with
this invocation: ./configure CC=c99 CXX=CC CFLAGS='-D__EXTENSIONS__ -mt'
